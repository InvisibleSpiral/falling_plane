# Welcome
Woah. My first README File! I always see these for roblox automation scripts / macros.

WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD THE ZIP FILE, MAKE SURE TO UNZIP IT AND INSIDE THE 'Flappy Bird' FILE THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER 'Flappy Bird' FILE. OPEN THE FIRST (MOTHER) 'Flappy Bird' FILE AND NOT THE FILE INSIDE

So, I got my inspiration from the video posted by Clear Code - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUFvY349ess and that is how I got most of my code, watch it if you want to create something like this!

This code was made for school purposes, as a final project to hand in. So dont expecet it to be good, im lazy.

Make sure to donate $2000 to my patreon ( I dont have one yet but you know, if you really want to just add InvisibleSpiral on discord and hit me up lowkey. )

# DESCRIPTION
The goal of this game is to simulate a spin-off based on the popular game, Flappy Bird. 
The gameplay is pretty basic, you just click the Left_Mouse_Button and you'll jump ! Avoid the obsticles, sky (top of the window) and the ground, each 1.2 seconds (about) that passes you gain +1 point, try to get the most amount of points out of your friends, or challenge yourself by beating a highscore. 
Objective? Dont crash, the planes cost a lot. Bet my highscore - 46

# Powerpoint structure
- Start the game file
- Run main code
- Game window opens
- Main music plays
- Sprites load on the page such as ground, plane and background
- Click left mouse button to move the plane upwards and play jumping sound, let go to let gravity bring the plane down
- Avoid obsticles that glide across the screen constantly until death - ground and stalagmites / tites at random sizes
- Every 1200 ms (1.2 seconds), add a poi, kill all sprites but ground and sky background, game ends and show reach home menu, play home menu music, only way to exit is to close the tab or left click again
- If score is greater than high score then change highcore value to the current score
- Click left mouse button
- Restart at a score of 0 - highscore stays the same
- End menu music and restart main music
- Game runs as usual

# Pseudocode - (Help.)
\\ Start:
    Play background music
    score = 0

\\ Sky appears:
    Glide across screen continuously

\\ Plane:
    Plane appears
    Click left mouse button
        Jump plane
        Play jumping "poing" sound effect
    Gravity
        Drop plane to the ground exponentially
    \\ If time passed = 1200ms:
        +1 point to score

\\ Obsticles:
    obsticles = Ground and Stalegmites / Stalegtites
    obsticles appear every 1.2 seconds at the top or bottom, randomly with random sizes
    Glide across screen 
    Kill once they exit screen

\\ If plane touches obsticles:
    kill all sprites but the ground and background
    play crash sound effect
    end game
    record score
    \\ if score > high score (initially 0):
        change high score to the new score value
    show menu with scores
    play menu music (waiting lobby)
    \\ if left mouse click:
        end menu music
            restart game
            reset scores
    else:
    nothing


# Reflection
The project went exactly to plan, it followed the pseudocode exactly! A main problem though was the leaderboard, it was ment to be local ( it resets everytime it is ran again ) but I could NOT get it to work. I had spent hours trying to fix it but it was alwaying being messed up, such as the previous score would always reset to the new score before you even start the game, vhat gpt couldnt even help me, the only possible explaination was that the previous score was getting updated during the game ran, but i could not bypass that problem no matter how hard chat gpt or I tried. The solution to this problem was to throw it all out and just add a high score module ( local ) which did work. That was the only problem I had with the code, and the only problem found. I tried using a flappy bird model but used different assets, such as a falling plane, which worked well. Another thting that sets my code differently from the rest is the scoring system, it's not "per obsticle passed" is just every 1.6 seconds ( originally ). The relection papers handed in by the game testers were insightful. Only good comments, with a few requests for additions, such as a warning symbol when a big obsticle was incoming, and making a wall with a hole in it to "thread the plane through", which i think means gettign the plant through the hole with insane timing. I would add these features to the game given time. Also maybe increasing the fall speed ( gravity intensity ).
